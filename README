Able to voice calls on Huawei and ZTE 3g-dongles.

Dependences:
    modemmanager,
    python2,
    python-dbus,
    python-gobject,
    python-serial,
    python-gst0.10,
    and python-gtk2 for GUI

Running:
Run "python2 atdrv.py" and then "python2 gui.py"
User must be in "uucp" group.


Then "Mobile broadband" unchecked in Network-Manager menu (port released), "atdrv"  captures modem interface and indicates incoming calls via DBUS, also able to outgoing calls.
"Gui" listens dbus signals and provide user interface.

You can write your own user interface such as unity-indicator or shell extension. I planning it for later.

Known issues:
    about one second incoming voice delay.
